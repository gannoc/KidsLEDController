Kids LED Controller
==========================================

This project was created to allow me to put RGB LED strip lighting into a children's playhouse using a rugged control box and some creativity and fun with the lights themselves.

The controller has 9 arcade-style buttons, each of a different color.  Pressing a color smoothly transitions the light strips to the requested color.

In addition, holding down two cr more colors causes the ligths to quickly flash between the colors of all of the pressed buttons.

The project runs on a standard Arduino Uno.   I use a 12V power supply to keep the lights bright.
